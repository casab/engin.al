Welcome to my blog! I'm **Engin Al**, a passionate software engineer with over 7 years of experience in backend development. I specialize in building scalable, high-performance systems and have worked with a wide array of technologies, including Python, Golang, and Rust. My focus is on data-driven solutions, system optimization, and cloud infrastructure, often with a strong emphasis on performance tuning and automation.

This blog serves as a space where I share my thoughts on software engineering, technology trends, and my experiences with different programming languages and frameworks. Whether it's optimizing backend systems, diving deep into Rust, or exploring the latest in machine learning, you'll find technical insights, tutorials, and lessons learned throughout my career.

### My Journey

I've had the pleasure of working with a range of amazing companies, from designing microservices at **Gowit** to contributing to e-commerce platforms at **Akinon**. Along the way, I've had the opportunity to lead technical interviews, mentor junior developers, and automate complex processes that have greatly improved system reliability and performance. Currently, I'm focusing on expanding my expertise in Rust while continuing to leverage my skills in Python and Go.

I also enjoy engaging with the developer community, whether it's through contributing to open-source projects or discussing the latest in tech on my GitHub and LinkedIn.
